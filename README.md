# DeepLearning

As the data is image type, therefore I have used Convolutional Neural Network.
There are two convolutional layers followed by pooling layers respectively. 

After flattening two hidden layers have been used with 64 and 32 neural units respectively.

Finally for output there are ten classes and softmax activation has been used for best accuracy.
